    "assessingFeedback": "Students can expect to receive feedback on all summative coursework within 20 working days of the submission deadline. The 28 calendar day deadline does not apply to work submitted late. Feedback can be accessed through the Turnitin assessment link on the course page. Further instructions on submitting an assessment and accessing feedback can be found on the University’s VLE.",
    "lateSubmissions": "Students Are Reminded to: Submit their assessment ahead of the published deadline. However, if assessments are submitted late without approved Extenuating Circumstances, there are penalties: Up to one day late of the published submission deadline = 5% points deducted from mark. For example, an assessment awarded 58% from the final mark recorded will be 53%. If the assessment is awarded 42% from the markers, the final mark recorded will be 37%. Two days late: any mark of 40% or higher will be capped at 40% for undergraduate students. Any mark of 50% or higher will be capped at 50% for postgraduate students. Any mark below 40% for undergraduate students and below 50% for postgraduate students, will stand. Students who do not submit their assessment within two days, and have no approved extenuating circumstances, are deemed to have failed that assessment element and the mark recorded will be 0%. For further information, please refer to AQF7 Academic Regulations for Taught Awards in the Academic Handbook.",
    "extenuatingCircumstances": "The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If the EC application is successful, there will be no academic penalty for missing the published submission deadline. Students are reminded that EC covers only short-term issues (within 28 days leading to the submission deadline) and that if they experience longer-term matters that impact on learning then they must contact Student Support and Development for advice. For further information, please refer to the Extenuating Circumstances Policy in the Academic Handbook.",
    "academicMisconduct": "Any submission must be a student’s own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The Academic Misconduct Policy includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct. Students should check this policy before submitting their work. Students suspected of committing Academic Misconduct will face action under the Policy. Where students are found to have committed an offence they will be subject to sanction, which may include failing an assessment, failing a course or being dismissed from the University depending upon the severity of the offence committed. For further information, please refer to the Academic Misconduct Policy in the Academic Handbook."
