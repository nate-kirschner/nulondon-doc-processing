                circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If the EC application is successful, 
                there will be no academic penalty for missing the published submission deadline. Students are reminded 
                that EC covers only short-term issues (within 28 days leading to the submission deadline) and that if 
                they experience longer-term matters that impact on learning then they must contact Student Support and 
                Development for advice. For further information, please refer to the Extenuating Circumstances Policy in the Academic Handbook."
